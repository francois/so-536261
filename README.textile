= so-536261: polymorphic bi-directional self-referential

This is an attempt at answering the StackOverflow question:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/536261/tricky-active-record-relationships-polymorphic-bi-directional-self-referential

Unfortunately, I end up with:

  ActiveRecord::HasManyThroughAssociationPolymorphicError: Cannot have a has_many :through association 'Publication#referenced' on the polymorphic object 'Referrer#referrer'.

I'm stuck at the moment.  The DB schema supports the use-case, but ActiveRecord doesn't at the moment.
